## What changed in v0.6.3

The current build moves Vordi toward the modern voice-first workflow users expect from tools like Wispr Flow, Superwhisper, Aqua, and MacWhisper, while keeping Vordi's own identity: a native macOS notch surface, local run history, local Memory, and open-source packaging.

- New Vordi name, logo, app icon, cask, docs, and release pipeline.
- Dynamic Notch UI with listening, thinking, done, error, and expanded panel states.
- Hover panel for latest transcriptions, Notes, Memory, Magic Words, and daily stats.
- Fn-first dictation with `Ctrl+Fn` hands-free mode and `Esc` to exit.
- Output controls simplified to `Original`, `English output`, and `Translate`.
- Magic Words, rich Notes, Run Log, Ask Memory, and Knowledge Graph are first-class surfaces.
- Homebrew tap moved to `raunaks068619/vordi/vordi`.

## Why Vordi

Most dictation apps compete on the same baseline: voice-to-text in every app, AI cleanup, custom prompts, provider choice, and transcript history. Vordi uses that bar as the floor, then adds a Mac-native workflow built around the notch and local context.

| Modern dictation expectation | Vordi's take |
|---|---|
| Works in any app | Hold `fn`, speak, release. Vordi injects into the focused field with synthesized macOS events. |
| Fast visual feedback | A Dynamic Notch surface shows listening, thinking, done, errors, and hands-free state without opening a window. |
| AI cleanup | Dictation and Rewrite modes route through Groq, OpenAI, or local OpenAI-compatible models. |
| Custom vocabulary | User vocabulary and profile-aware cleanup protect product names, people, commands, and code terms. |
| Context-aware output | Vordi can capture active app/window context, selected text, and optional screenshot context from Settings. |
| History | Run Log stores the full local pipeline: audio, raw STT, final text, model route, latency, prompts, and errors. |
| Memory | Past dictations become a local searchable corpus, entity graph, and Ask Memory chat with cited sources. |
| Workflow commands | Magic Words turn spoken triggers into snippets, app actions, and repeatable command expansions. |

## Product tour

<p align="center">
  <img width="100%" alt="Vordi fn dictation flow from listening to thinking to done" src="docs/readme/vordi-fn-flow.gif" />
</p>

These README captures are generated from [docs/vordi-notch.html](docs/vordi-notch.html), the web replica used to validate the notch states, panel spacing, and slide isolation.

```bash
python3 docs/readme/capture_notch_media.py
```

### Dynamic Notch

The primary UI is a black notch-mounted pill, not a floating modal. It stays within menu-bar height while idle, thinking, and done. It only drops down for active listening or when the expanded panel is opened.

- `fn` listening state with live meter and release affordance.
- Thinking dots and done tick for quick post-release feedback.
- Hover panel with carousel slides for transcripts, Notes, Memory, and stats.
- No focus stealing while you are writing in another app.

### Output modes

| Mode | What lands in the target app |
|---|---|
| `Original` | Raw transcription with minimal cleanup. Best when exact words matter. |
| `English output` | Mixed speech written in English letters. Useful for Hinglish and multilingual workflows. |
| `Translate` | Spoken input translated into natural English. |

Processing mode decides how much the LLM reshapes the result:

- `Dictation`: keep phrasing close to what you said.
- `Rewrite`: tighten grammar, collapse restarts, and improve structure before injection.

### Magic Words

Magic Words are spoken triggers that expand during cleanup. Use them for repeatable snippets, dev commands, and app actions.

Examples:

```text
"open codex and draft a release checklist"
"git wip"
"reply with thanks for the context"
"summarize this as action items"
```

### Notes

Vordi includes a rich-text Notes workspace and a detachable floating notes window. You can dictate into notes, keep release thoughts nearby, and use the notch panel to jump back into the surface quickly.

### Memory and Run Log

<p align="center">
  <img width="49%" alt="Vordi Memory panel slide" src="docs/readme/vordi-panel-memory.png" />
  <img width="49%" alt="Vordi Today stats panel slide" src="docs/readme/vordi-panel-stats.png" />
</p>

Run Log is the audit trail for a dictation. Memory is what happens when those runs become useful later.

| Surface | What it does |
|---|---|
| Run Log | Lists every dictation with audio, raw text, final text, provider, model, prompt metadata, latency, and errors. |
| Memory Store | Stores transcript history locally with SQLite and full-text search. |
| Knowledge Graph | Extracts people, projects, tools, concepts, commands, and relationships from your dictations. |
| Ask Memory | Answers questions over past dictations using hybrid retrieval and cited local sources. |

## Quickstart

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask raunaks068619/vordi/vordi
```

### Manual DMG

1. Download the latest DMG from [Releases](https://github.com/Raunaks068619/Vordi/releases/latest).
2. Drag `Vordi.app` to `/Applications`.
3. Right-click `Vordi.app`, then choose Open.

Current public builds are ad-hoc signed beta builds. If macOS quarantine blocks launch, run:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Vordi.app
codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/Vordi.app
open /Applications/Vordi.app
```

### Run from source

```bash
open Vordi.xcodeproj
```

Select the `Vordi` scheme in Xcode 15 or newer, then run `Product -> Run`.

## System requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| macOS | macOS 13 Ventura or newer |
| CPU | Apple Silicon recommended |
| Permissions | Microphone, Accessibility, Input Monitoring |
| App type | Menu-bar app, no Dock icon by design |
| Release | `v0.6.3`, build `21` |

## Hotkeys

| Shortcut | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `fn` hold | Record while held, transcribe and inject on release. |
| `Ctrl+fn` | Start hands-free mode. |
| `fn` while hands-free | Stop hands-free mode and process the recording. |
| `Esc` | Exit hands-free mode without another `fn` press. |

If `fn` does not register, set `System Settings -> Keyboard -> Press fn key to` to `Do Nothing` or disable the macOS Dictation shortcut that consumes the globe / fn key.

## Providers

Vordi separates transcription, cleanup, and Memory answers so you can pick the right tradeoff.

| Layer | Options |
|---|---|
| Transcription | Groq or OpenAI Whisper-compatible paths, with realtime transcription support where configured. |
| Cleanup / rewrite | Groq, OpenAI, LM Studio, Ollama, or another OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint. |
| Memory chat | Current polish backend, local HTTP models, or detected local CLI backends such as Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI. |

Provider defaults are practical: Groq gives a free fast path, OpenAI unlocks stronger paid processing, and local models keep cleanup or Memory chat on your machine when you run LM Studio or Ollama.

## Privacy model

Vordi is local-first for history and memory, not cloud-only.

- Run Log files live under Application Support.
- Memory uses local SQLite, FTS5, embeddings, and entity links.
- Clipboard capture is opt-in and off by default.
- Screenshot context is opt-in from Settings.
- Audio/text is sent to whichever transcription or LLM provider you configure, unless you route that layer to a local model.

## Permissions

Vordi needs three macOS permissions:

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| Microphone | Capture your voice while the hotkey is active. |
| Accessibility | Paste or type the final text into the focused app. |
| Input Monitoring | Detect global `fn` and `Ctrl+fn` outside Vordi. |

If a permission is missing, Vordi disables the relevant hotkey path and shows a guided fix. For step-by-step help, read [PERMISSIONS.md](PERMISSIONS.md).
