# Vordi — Clean Uninstall
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Removes EVERYTHING Vordi has placed on disk + wipes the macOS
# permission grants so the next install starts from a clean slate.
#
# What this nukes:
#   • The app bundle (/Applications/Vordi.app — both Homebrew + manual)
#   • UserDefaults / preferences
#   • Application Support (run logs, magic words registry, audio files,
#     custom vocabulary, anything you ever dictated)
#   • Caches, logs, saved state, cookies, HTTPStorages
#   • TCC permission grants (Microphone, Accessibility, Input Monitoring)
#
# What it does NOT touch:
#   • Your OpenAI / Groq API keys stored OUTSIDE Vordi (e.g. env vars)
#   • The Homebrew tap itself (you can re-install with the same command)
#   • Anything in /Library (system-wide install — Vordi doesn't use it)
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/uninstall.sh              # interactive (asks before deleting)
#   ./scripts/uninstall.sh --force      # skip confirmation
#
# After running, restart Mac (recommended — TCC sometimes caches grants
# in memory) and re-install via:
#   brew install --cask raunaks068619/vordi/vordi

# `--force` skips the "version not installed" abort when the receipt is
# already partial; `--zap` would also remove user data, which we handle
